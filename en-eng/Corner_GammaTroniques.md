# GammaTroniques TICMeter Integration

## Overview

Purpose is to describe the integration of the GamaTroniques's TICMeter which allows to retreive the Linky "tele-info"


## Integration status

The general approach has been to be as generic as possible to handle all TIC and Electrical modes (Historique, Standard, Mono, Tri). The result will be that after pairing a TICMeter you'll get a quiet extensive number of widgets created in Domoticz.
Depending on your Linky setup, some will work, and some others won't.

For now, in Tri-Phase mode, Power_f4 is not updated, as there is a miss-match in the reporting an Power L1 (SINSTS1) seems to be reported as General Power (SINSTS)
