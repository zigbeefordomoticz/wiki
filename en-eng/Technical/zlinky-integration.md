# Zlinky TIC Integration

## Overview

Purpose is to describe the integration of the ZLinky_TIC module in the plugin and Domoticz

## Integration status

* Minimum ZLinky version is V5.
* For Standard mode, Historique Tri mode the number of Reporting to be configured are above the limite of V5, so it is adviced to use the up coming firmware version. For now we have tested V6 and it seems to be working however not recommended by the manufacturer for production usage. So until a new release is officialy announced you might get some restrictions with the V5.

## Domoticz Widgets after ZLinky pairing

![ZLinky Widgets on Domoticz](../Images/ZLinky-Widgets.png)

Afer pairing your Zlinky module quiet an extensive numbers of Widgets will be created ( 11 in Total)

* In Base, or EJP contract and Mono phase setup the BLUE widgets will be used
* If your installation is tri-phases, then the ORANGE will be used in addition
* In case you have a TEMPO contract the RED widget will be used in addition

In conclusion if you have a TEMPO contract with a tri-phase installation, then all 11 widgets are going to be used.

The 11 Widgets will be used if you are in tri-phases and TEMPO subscription.
In case of mono-phase and Base Contract only the Blue widgets will be used
In case you have a tri-phase

### Description of each Widget

1. `_Power 01`: report the apparent power. ATTENTION, this is is not real power in W, but only AV.
2. `_Meter 01`: report apparent power and meter it, so you can get the accumulated power a long the day. ATTENTION, this is is not real power in W, but only AV. This widget as been discontinued as it is not possible to manage several Indexes.
3. `_Ampere3 01`: report the current. If you have a tri-phases setup, all phase/line will be reported into this one, allowing you to see if this is well balanced.

`_P1Meter_SL xx` counters are updated only when receiving a new comsuption state and consequently the Power displayed on the P1Meter widget will be updated at that time. You can notice some discrapency between the P1Meter Power and the Power reported on the `_Power 01` or `_Meter 01` which are updated every time a power update is provided

4. `_P1Meter_ZL 01`: report the power consumption, and manage peak and off-peak power (for Base, EJP contract; for Tempo it will report Blue days consumption)
5. `_P1Meter_ZL f2`: report power consumption, manage peak and off-peak power of TEMPO contract. White day.
6. `_P1Meter_ZL f3`: report power consumption, manage peak and off-peak power of TEMPO contract. Red day.
7. `_Alarm_ZL 01`: Will report alarm on Intensity for mono and phase 1 of tri-phases setup
8. `_Alarm_ZL f2`: Will report alarm on Intensity for phase 2 of tri-phases setup
9. `_Alarm_ZL f3`: Will report alarm on Intensity for phase 3 of tri-phases setup
10. `_Alarm_ZL2 01`: Will report Next day color for TEMPO contract, or Mobile Peak for EJP contract
11. `_Alarm_ZL3 01`: Will report the tarif of the day

## IMPORTANT (for now)

In case you are in BASE or EJP contract, and you decide to remove some of the widgets which are not used actually, you can. But if later on you move from BASE to TEMPO contract , unfortunatly the removed widgets won't be created, and you will have to start from scratch ( removeing all widgets and redoing the pairing)

## Automatic reporting and configuration

Zigbee allows to configure the device to report automatically attributes either on value change or after a period of Time.
For those who have a TI or SiliconLabs or deConz based coordinator, you can edit the reporting setting.
Please be aware that the ZLinky firwmare is putting some constraint and not all of the attribute can be automatically reported.


All Indexes ( Base, HCHP, EJP, BBRx ) are configured with the following setting

| Setting | Value | Description |
| ------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Min | 0x000e ( 15 )  | Cannot be often than every 15 secondes |
| Max | 0x0e10 ( 3600) | Cannot be less than every hours |
| Change | 0x1 | as soon as there is 1 more Wh to the index it should be reported (depending on the MIN) |

Instant Power ( or Puissance Apparente ) is configured as follow:

| Setting | Value | Description |
| ------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Min | 0x000e ( 15 )  | Cannot be often than every 15 secondes |
| Max | 0x0e10 ( 3600) | Cannot be less than every hours |
| Change | 0x1 | as soon as there is 1 Ampere change it should be reported (depending on the MIN) |


## Polling mecanism

Because ZLinky doesn't provide Configure Reporting capabilities for all attributes, we have put in place a polling mecanism with the following parameters

| Parameter | Default Value | Description |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| PollingCusterff66 | 86400 | Will read all ZLinky manufacturer relevant attributes |
| ZLinkyPollingGlobal | 86400 | Will read all ZLinky attributes on cluster  0x0702, 0x0b01, 0x0b04 | 
| ZLinkyPollingPTEC | 900 | Every 900s ( 15 minutes) we retreive the Current Tarif. This will allow to get if we are in HC, HP ... |
| ZLinkyIndexes | "12:30" | Will retreive the PTEC information at a specific time here 12:30 |
